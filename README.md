Project “Deccan-Herald ”
Before I start my blog writing on the clone of the website, I want to thank Masai School for this great opportunity and for providing this great platform to enhance my coding and life skills.
We have tried our level best to make use of the knowledge that we have gained so far at Masai School💚 to come up with our fourth project.
✌️Getting Started:-

It was a very challenging journey for me and for all my team members as we had to complete the project within the time of construct week, so we faced different challenges as it was our 4th project and we did not have any experience with React but we are working in a team So we started with planning and studying the website, then we distributed the workflow, the roles, and responsibilities and with great collaboration, we managed the work and completed this project.
